## Abstract

This project is an implementation of the Connect 4 game played against an AI opponent. The project will use several small computing devices, such as Raspberry Pis, to achiecve this. The robot will operate by using a camera to asses the current state of a game, make some calculations and use an algorithm to make the move decision, and it will be able to determine when the game is over. We may have the robot make the moves automatically using actuators and the like, or we may just have the machine output its desired move on a screen.
